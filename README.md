# qr-keyboard

The project is created to easily send data that must be typed on an android device, but the data is stored on a computer. For example you have to login somewhere on the phone, however the password is stored with a passwordmanger on the computer. 

The qr generator is a python script that is able to generata a qr code where the text is encrypted using aes encryption.

The android app is a keyboard that is able to scan the code and then 'types' the scanned data.

Encryption is optional and the keys can also be exchanged using a qr code.
